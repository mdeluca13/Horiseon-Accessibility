# Horiseon-Accessibility

## Description

I was given the code for the Horiseon Website and I ensured it was accessible for all users. I ensured all code was using proper Semantic HTML Elements and was using logical structure. As well, I made sure all images had alt attributes. By making these adjustments, users who are using read outloud programs are able to identify each section of the webpage as well as know what images are showing. Without these additions and adjustments of the code, not all users are able to fully interact with the webpage. I was able to work through trial and error to ensure all additions and adjustments that were made did not negatively impact the webpage's look and functionality. 

## Installation

n/a
